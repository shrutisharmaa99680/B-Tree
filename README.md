# B-Tree
Self implemented indexes of a mock RDBMS implementation using B-Trees to improve query performance. Without index, the RDBMS query is  served via page scan and with index created the RDBMS query is served  via index seek leading to lesser numbers of data page loads from hard  disk and a higher performance.
